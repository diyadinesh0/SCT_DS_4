# Traffic Accident Analysis using Tableau

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a focused analysis of traffic accident data using Tableau. The dashboard explores how accidents vary based on driver age groups, weather conditions, and road surface conditions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze accident distribution across different driver age groups  
- Understand the impact of weather conditions on accidents  
- Study how road surface conditions influence accident occurrence  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Tableau Desktop  
- Tableau Public  
- CSV Dataset

## 📊 Dashboard Analysis
The interactive dashboard includes the following three visualizations:

1. **Age Group of Drivers vs Number of Accidents**  
   Helps identify which driver age groups are more frequently involved in accidents.

2. **Weather Condition vs Number of Accidents**  
   Shows how different weather conditions affect accident frequency.

3. **Road Surface Condition vs Number of Accidents**  
   Highlights the relationship between road surface conditions and accident occurrence.
